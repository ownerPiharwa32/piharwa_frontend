        <p style="margin-top: 20px;">A junction where art meets elegance, beauty meets grace and where the artists meet the consumers.</p><br/>
        <p>Sculpted by the fusion of ethnics with aesthetics and traditions with avant-garde Piharwa is the reflection of you. The brand has taken up this initiative of bringing up the Indian fabrics and the beautiful works of our artisans as a statement of snazzy. Piharwa is conceptualised with the motivation of being committed to let the consumers express their eccentricity and not just buy clothes. Piharwa- the Beloved; this commitment has nurtured us from being just a cloth store to being a leading fashion specialist in the league; it’s not just a brand, it’s a way of life.</p><br/>
        <p>We are the elements of this earth, made up of soil and equipped with our own hands!</p><br/>
        <p>Procuring and preserving the rare essence of handwork and handlooms, we keep our faith in the true forms of tradition. Along with this, we thrive on the universal philosophy of giving back. We believe that being contemporary for the sake of belonging is very mundane. We can remain relevant even by tracing our roots and staying true to them. So whether it is bringing the rarest of Indian weaving styles and a true mold of Indian culture to modern India or it is sharing the proceeds with the weaver and the craftsman at the last mile, our aim is to try & stitch and reframe Bharat into India with myriad threads of love and most beautiful pieces of artifacts.</p><br/>
        <p>In route to our dream, we also take up causes that affect the new-age Indian citizen and weave or mold an optimistic solution-oriented stance around them. With India in our hearts, we started our first store in the heart of the country, Bhopal. And now touching the routes of every city through e-commerce, our journey has been very fulfilling and we wish to grow stronger and deeper into the hearts of our customers.</p><br/>
        <p>Beautify your wardrobe with the graceful collection of Piharwa.</p><br/>
        <p>India is the home of exquisite clothing and a variety of fabrics, filled with exotic appeal. Ornamented with delicate and distinctive designs, carrying intricate traditions and values we are bringing for you the best of the chosen pieces from the beautiful fabric lanes of India. A Brand for you, created to suit you and to define you. Itâ€™s a simple move to stop these Indian fabric arts from succumbing to modern technology and getting buried in the fast-growing machinery methods.</p><br/>
        <p>Owning and wearing these beautiful pieces of art which have been put together carefully and delicately into beautiful dresses is a feeling of pride and style.</p><br/>
